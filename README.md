# Focis annotated duke dataset
This repository contains images from DUKE dataset with hyperreflective focis (HRFs) areas demarcated.

## HRFs segmentation

HRFs segmentation is presented in our paper [Segmentation of retinal fluids and hyperreflective foci using deep learning approach in optical coherence tomography scans]
(https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11583/115830H/Segmentation-of-retinal-fluids-and-hyperreflective-foci-using-deep-learning/10.1117/12.2579934.short?SSO=1).
